# Introduction
The BOMOS Substantiation discusses the components that make up BOMOS. In addition to operational, tactical and strategic layers, it also deals with implementation support and communication.
The BOMOS documentation is divided into various sections (see [[[#bomos-structure]]]).

## Purpose
The purpose of this publication is to assist organisations in compiling and improving the management of standards. This publication provides answers among others to the following questions:

* How can we successfully (further) develop and manage the standard in our organisation?
* How can be structure development and management in such a way that it results in an open standard?
* How can we improve the adoption rate of our standard among users?

Thes specific questions were the original reason for drawing up the Management and Development Model for Open Standards (BOMOS) with its best practice guidelines for an open structure for management. Since that time, BOMOS has been used in practice, and users have expressed the need to share more knowledge and experience with the management of standards.  Other issues such as improving interoperability based on standards, transparency and the manageability of standards have been added. Finally BOMOS is now used as the common language in the world of standardisation.

## BOMOS structure
BOMOS consists of:
* BOMOS Part 1: [The Foundation](https://gitdocumentatie.logius.nl/publicatie/bomos/fundament/en/)
* BOMOS Part 2: [The Substantiation](https://gitdocumentatie.logius.nl/publicatie/bomos/verdieping/en/)
* BOMOS Supplementary modules: Linked Data (this document) en [Stelsels](https://gitdocumentatie.logius.nl/publicatie/bomos/stelsels/en/)

The heart of BOMOS is the [Foundation](https://gitdocumentatie.logius.nl/publicatie/bomos/fundament/en/). This consists of a basic description of the Management and Development Model and a further elaboration based on literature and experiences gained in practice.  In essence, the Management and Development Model is an activity diagram which also offers a definition of the roles relevant in the process of managing and developing standards.

The _Substantiation_ (this document) offers further insight in particular by sharing best practices from the world of standardisation.

Together Part 1 and Part 2 form the basis for BOMOS.

On top of this basic structure, the community has produced a number of BOMOS expansions which can be useful in deploying BOMOS in concrete situations, some of which may involve a slightly different context. We refer to these as the BOMOS Supplementary Modules or a Body of Knowledge, which will remain dynamic over time.

When we talk about BOMOS, what we are actually referring to is the basis as described in [Part 1](https://gitdocumentatie.logius.nl/publicatie/bomos/fundament/en/) and Part 2. Although the supplementary modules are clearly linked to BOMOS, they have their own governance, which can result in their being given their own name, their own target group, their own management system, etc. The [BOMOS management process](https://gitdocumentatie.logius.nl/publicatie/bomos/fundament/en/#the-management-and-development-model-design-for-development-and-management) also describes the requirements that are imposed before something can be added as a BOMOS supplementary module.

 The first two supplementary modules are:
-	[Linked Data & OntologieÃ«n](https://gitdocumentatie.logius.nl/publicatie/bomos/linkeddata/en/):
  the specific use of Linked Data for sematic standards.
-	Structure for [BOMOS for the management of trust framework](https://gitdocumentatie.logius.nl/publicatie/bomos/stelsels/en/): the use of BOMOS in the specific situation governing trust frameworks.

## Reading guide
If from your policy making or administrative role you are only interested in the primary level, the foundation (part 1) will offer sufficient
background and context. If however you are personally active in standardisation communities, you can seamlessly continue with reading part 2: The substantiation with best practices, which includes more background and practical tips for standardisation.

If you actually intend to make use of BOMOS, it is advisable that you also study the supplementary modules. These contain examples and tools that could prove useful for implementing open standards. The supplementary modules also contain variants on BOMOS. These implementation profiles make BOMOS suitable for use with more than just semantic standards.
